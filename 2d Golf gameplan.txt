user agreement gag lmao

mainmenu:
play - 1 player, 2 player, 3 player, 4 player

for music and volume sliders uhhhhh maybe just have em be presets and only save when you select save at the bottom

on release of hold, start angle moving

animate ball in play flashing for half second then aiming

then it shoots
