Sfx made with SFXR

Updated a few things since the original upload. Original version was in a playable state but had a few extra bugs and lack of polish in a few places. Not likely going to put more time in now that I've added these, but if anyone actually has enough fun to ask, with this I'd be willing to make more levels lol
